## 🚀 How to Add a Recipe

### Just Tell Cursor What You Want!

Open the Cursor chat (click the chat icon or press `Cmd + L`) and say something like:

> **"Add a new recipe for grandma's lasagna to the cookbook"**

Cursor will:
- ✅ Create a new recipe page with all the details
- ✅ Add a card to the homepage
- ✅ Format everything to match our style

### More Example Prompts:

| What you want | What to say to Cursor |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Add a recipe | *"Add a recipe for spicy chicken tacos with a 30 min cook time"* |
| Add details | *"The tacos recipe should include cilantro lime crema as a topping"* |
| Add your name | *"Make sure it says the recipe is by Tasha"* |
| Be specific | *"Add my mom's banana bread recipe: 3 bananas, 1 cup sugar, 1/3 cup melted butter, 1 egg, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp baking soda, pinch of salt, 1.5 cups flour. Bake at 350 for 60 mins"* |

### After Cursor Makes Changes:

1. **Review the changes** — Cursor will show you what it created
2. **Click "Accept"** on the changes you like
3. **Push to GitHub:**
   - Click the **Source Control** icon (🌿 branch icon in left sidebar)
   - Type a message like: `Add grandma's lasagna`
   - Click **✓ Commit**
   - Click **Sync Changes** (↑↓ arrows)

Your recipe will be live on the site in about 1 minute!

## 📸 Adding Photos

### Let Cursor Handle It!

If you have a photo of your dish, just say:

> **"Add my photo taco-night.jpg to the tacos recipe"**

First, drag your photo into the `images` folder in Cursor's file explorer, then ask Cursor to link it up!

### Or Do It Yourself:

1. Drag your photo into the `images` folder
2. Tell Cursor: *"Use the image images/my-photo.jpg for the lasagna recipe"*

## 🎨 Changing the Design

### Yes, You Can Redesign the Whole Site!

Want to change how the cookbook looks? Just ask! Here are some ideas:

| What you want | What to say |
|---------------|-------------|
| New colors | *"Change the color scheme to blue and gold"* |
| Different font | *"Use a more playful, handwritten-style font"* |
| Dark mode | *"Make the site dark mode with a cozy nighttime feel"* |
| Bigger recipe cards | *"Make the recipe cards on the homepage larger with bigger photos"* |
| Complete redesign | *"Redesign the whole site with a rustic farmhouse aesthetic"* |
| Holiday theme | *"Add a festive holiday theme with snowflakes"* |

### ⚠️ Design Etiquette

Before making big design changes, **check with the team** in our group chat! We want everyone to love how the cookbook looks.

Small changes to your own recipe pages are totally fine anytime.

## 🛠️ Fixing Problems

Just describe the problem to Cursor:

- *"The image on my recipe isn't showing up"*
- *"The text is too small on mobile"*
- *"My recipe card isn't linking to the right page"*
- *"The layout looks broken on the homepage"*

Cursor will find and fix the issue!

## 🆘 Common Questions

**"Cursor isn't responding"**
→ Make sure you're in the chat panel (Cmd + L) not just the editor

**"I can't push my changes"**
→ Make sure you committed first (Source Control → Commit), then Sync Changes

**"The site isn't updating"**
→ GitHub Pages can take 1-2 minutes to update. Refresh and wait!

**"I messed something up"**
→ Tell Cursor: *"Undo the last changes I made to index.html"*
→ Or ask: *"Can you restore the recipe template to its original state?"*
