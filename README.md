Cursor will create the recipe page AND add it to the homepage. Done!

### More Examples:

- *"Add a recipe for chocolate lava cake — make it sound fancy and indulgent"*
- *"Add Brian's lemon garlic pasta but with shrimp this time"*

## 🎨 Go Ahead — Redesign Everything!

**This is the fun part.** We're the Retail Brand Team — we know good design when we see it. If you find a website you love, just tell Cursor to copy that vibe!

### Try These:

> **"Redesign this cookbook to look like Malaproject.com"**

> **"Make this site look like a high-end restaurant menu — think Eleven Madison Park"**

> **"Give the site an Apple.com aesthetic — clean, minimal, lots of whitespace"**

> **"Make it look like a vintage 1970s cookbook with retro typography"**

> **"Redesign everything with a Japanese minimalist aesthetic like Muji"**

### More Design Ideas:

| Vibe | What to Say |
|------|-------------|
| Editorial | *"Make it look like Bon Appétit magazine's website"* |
| Luxury | *"Give it an Aesop.com aesthetic"* |
| Playful | *"Make it colorful and fun like a Glossier site"* |
| Dark & Moody | *"Dark mode with rich photography like a wine bar menu"* |
| Handcrafted | *"Make it feel like a hand-illustrated zine"* |
| Brutalist | *"Redesign with a raw, brutalist web design style"* |

**Don't hold back!** Share a link, describe a feeling, reference a brand — Cursor will figure it out.

## 📸 Adding Photos

Drag your photo into the `images` folder, then tell Cursor:

> **"Add my photo taco-night.jpg to the tacos recipe"**

That's it!

---

## ✏️ Editing & Tweaking

Want to change something? Just say it:

- *"Make the homepage cards bigger"*
- *"Change the font to something more elegant"*
- *"Add a dark mode toggle"*
- *"The header should be sticky when you scroll"*
- *"Add animations when the recipe cards load"*

## 💡 Tips

- **Be bold** — Big redesigns are encouraged!
- **Reference real sites** — "Make it look like X" works great
- **Describe feelings** — "Make it feel cozy" or "more premium"
- **Iterate** — Say "I like it but make the text bigger" to refine
- **Commit often** — Push your changes so others can see them

## 🆘 Quick Fixes

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Can't push | Did you commit first? Source Control → Commit → then Sync |
| Site not updating | Wait 1-2 min for GitHub Pages to refresh |
